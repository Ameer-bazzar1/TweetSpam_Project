As deep learning focuses on building a network that resembles a human mind, sound\nrecognition is also essential. While image classification has become much advanced and widespread, audio classification is still a relatively new concept.\nThe mean idea of this project is to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify a given short duration sound (e.g. 10 seconds) into one of a predefined\nsound events such as music, human speech, vehicle, boom, crumpling, etc.  Audio classification can be helpful in query based multimedia retrieval, acoustic scene\nanalysis, and bio-diversity monitoring.\nFor this project, we can work on Google AudioSet, which is a vast collection of labeled audio that they collected from YouTube videos. They all are 10-seconds\nlong and are incredibly varied. We can use the audio files present in AudioSet to train and test our models. They are correctly labeled, so working with them is\nrelatively more straightforward. There are currently 632 audio event classes and more than two million sound clips present in AudioSet\n(https://research.google.com/audioset/).\n"}, {"id": 2, "supervisor": "Dr. Abualseoud Hanani\n", "title": "Machine learning-based system for\nevaluating short stories understanding\nfor Arabic speaking children\n", "description": "The main idea of this project is to develop a system that is able to evaluate the correctness of response of children (learners) for a given question upon a specific\ntopic automatically. A set of carefully-selected multimedia prompts; text, picture, audio, or video describing specific topics, will be displayed to the child  and then\nhe/she is asked to answer specific questions upon what he/she has seen and heard in his/her language. The learner response represents how well he/she understands\nthe topic and his/her ability to formulate the ideas and the strength in the language. All of these skills can be analyzed and evaluated by the proposed automatic\nsystem in terms of the meaning and maybe the language.  In addition to the general evaluation, the system gives the child a feedback about his/her weakness and\nstrengths.\nThe proposed system is a multi-disciplinary system which uses different technology in computer science such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech\nprocessing and machine learning. All prompts and responses will be in Arabic language.\nTo make it clearer, to encourage the child to go on, the prompts could be an Arabic learning story (displayed in a form of text or audio or pictures) which talks\nabout a specific idea. It will be divided into parts and after each part it will display a question to the child upon what\u2019s previously displayed to him/her.
