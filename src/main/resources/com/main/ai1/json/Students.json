They all are 10-seconds\nlong and are incredibly varied. We can use the audio files present in AudioSet to train and test our models.

Static summaries are formed from a set of images representing key events called\nkeyframes, which also convey the video's temporal evolution. Static summaries are less entertaining than their dynamic counterparts as they are limited to still\nimages. However, they introduce a more practical approach when extending video summarization to an applied video management and indexing solution. In this\nproject, we will do video indexing based of the keyframes resulted form video summarization. Video indexing is the process of providing watchers a way to\naccess and navigate contents easily; similar to book indexing.
